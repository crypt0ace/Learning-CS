## Learning C#:
Hi. This repository contains my notes and different binaries I made while learning C# from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php) (props to them). Uploading it for anyone who would like to use them to learn it or whatever. Would recommend to go through W3 Schools course because I may have omited some stuff for myself.
<br>
### Structure:
The structure is simple. It contains the PDF of notes I took on Notion app. The Learn folder contains the code that is in the course but in program form. Also the snippets are mentioned in the notes.
<br>
The practice folder contains some binaries I made to practice C# coding. Some may be incomplete, some may have not so cool code. The list of working ones is:
- [Vault](https://github.com/crypt0ace/Learning-CS/tree/main/Practice/Vault)
- [GuessTheNumber Game](https://github.com/crypt0ace/Learning-CS/tree/main/Practice/GuessTheNumber)
- [DemoApp](https://github.com/crypt0ace/Learning-CS/tree/main/Practice/DemoApp)

## TODO:
- Make a list of tutorials in `Learn` in order.
